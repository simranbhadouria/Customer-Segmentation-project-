# Customer-Segmentation-project-
Description:
As part of my MBA Business Analytics coursework, I worked on customer segmentation for a fictional online retail company to help the marketing team design targeted strategies. The project involved data cleaning, analysis, applying RFM segmentation, clustering, and building visual dashboards.

Project Steps & Methodology:
Data Collection & Cleaning: Imported CSV data containing customer transactions — CustomerID, InvoiceDate, InvoiceNo, Quantity, UnitPrice.

Feature Engineering:
Calculated Recency (days since last purchase), Frequency (number of purchases), and Monetary (total spend).

Segmentation:
Used K-Means clustering on scaled RFM data to segment customers.

Visualization:
Created plots and dashboards to showcase customer segments and insights.
Outcome:
Identified 4 customer segments (e.g., loyal, at-risk, new, big spenders). Provided insights for personalized marketing strategies.

Tools & Techniques Used:
Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn), K-Means Clustering, RFM analysis, data visualization
